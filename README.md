# Insurance-Claim-Simulation

[Insert brief overview of the analysis]


## Simulating Insurance Claim Sizes

A brief summary of our methodology is as follows:

***Step 1.*** We use the inversion method to simulate from $`X`$. Our first step is to create a function
invpar that calculates the inverse Pareto CDF 𝐹−1(𝑢) as defined above.

$\hat{a}$

$`a^2+b^2=c^2`$

***Step 2.*** We create a function rpar which returns n simulated values from a Pareto distribution
with parameters α, β. The first part of the function generates n random values from a uniform
